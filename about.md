**<center>Hi, I'm Madan Thangavelu</center>**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to my space. This website is a collection of ideas and essays that cover technical topics on running large internet companies. My focus revolves around the wisdom that comes from technology implementations in practice and not on aspirational text book definitions of technology.

If you like hacker news, high scalability like blogs, you will likely resonate with the content of this blog.

My hand picked **articles** include [REST is not a standard][1] and [An opinionated REST URL design][2].

I am a **speaker** at tech conferences. Here is a link to a talk on lessons from [building an API management platform][3] and [building magical/responsive user experiences on cellular networks][4].

**My goal** is to help engineers and managers realize that technology is all about tradeoffs, both in technical and non-technical areas. 

> Engineering tradeoffs are what brings creativity to what we do.

 In some small way I would like to unveil the hood covering the *less than perfect* technical and non-technical machinery that powers your favorite internet company.

You can also find me on twitter.

Thank you,

Madan
