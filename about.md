**<center>Hi, I'm Madan Thangavelu</center>**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome and thank you for your time! I have been drawn to technology since 2000. Over the last 5 years, I have spent my time in management.

The belief that engineering leaders have all the information they need before they act is not quite true in practice. 

As I interacted with other engineering leaders and mentored some, I noticed that everyone seems to be re-discovered the art of technical management from scratch. The community needs to come forward and share more with each other. This will ultimately benefit the team that relies on us.

We need to peek through the cracks and the imperfections of technology and management that anyone hardly talks about. This blog is an attempt at doing that.

My hand picked **articles** include [REST is not a standard][1] and [An opinionated REST URL design][2].

I am a **speaker** at tech conferences. Here is a link to a talk on lessons from [building an API management platform][3] and [building magical/responsive user experiences on cellular networks][4].

Finally, In some small way I would like to unveil the hood covering the *less than perfect* technical and management machinery that powers your favorite internet company.

&nbsp;

Thank you,

Madan
